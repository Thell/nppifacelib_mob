Solution Notes:

- For setup and usage information see the writeup on notepadplus.almostautomated.com.

- Interesting to note that the C++ properties page for Additional Include directories won't
correctly expand macros that are inside of quotes.

- The build configuration names have been changed from "Release Unicode" and "Debug Unicode" to
"Release_Unicode" and "Debug_Unicode" to allow for proper environment macro expansions, since
a space in a dir name needs to be embedded in quotes.

- Notepad++ vcproj altered to show dependency on scintilla, just so it would build first...

- Project warning levels for Notepad++ and Scintilla are off.  Odds are they won't
need to be rebuilt after the initial build, but when they are there is no need to see all those
messages.  This is for working on plugins, not Scintilla or Notepad++; if they are going to be
worked on, either create a new solution or increase the warning levels to stay out of trouble.
 
- Remember that there aren't dependencies setup between the projects...

Misc notes about some of the extensions:

_Markers:
- It would be nice to add a markergetback and markergetfor so plugins could watch for style
  updates and for changed values without having to reload and read the values from a file.
